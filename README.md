# Blog Project - README

## Overview
This is a blog project built with **Astro**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and with **MDX** for writing blog posts. The app is deployed on **Netlify** and uses **NPM** as the package manager. It includes basic page structures like a home page, a blog list page, and a single blog page with server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Home Page**: A simple, blank page as a placeholder for future content.
- **Blogs Page**: A list of pre-rendered blog posts.
- **Single Blog Page**: Displays individual blog posts with SSR capabilities for dynamic content.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and NPM installed.
- Netlify account for deployment.

## How to Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:MaxShvachko/astro-example.git
   cd astro-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary packages using NPM:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   To start the app in development mode, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build the App for Production**:
   If you want to build the app for production, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   Connect your project repository to Netlify and deploy directly from your Git repository. Netlify will handle the build process and deploy the app automatically.

## Project Structure
